A repository for BCO example flat files. 

## Table of Contents:

* [HCV1a](HCV1a.json) - This BCO was developed with the [Reproducibility and Interpretation use case](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification/blob/master/introduction.md#reproducibility-and-interpretation-use-case) in mind. This is the archetypal BCO example and is in the [BCO Specification](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification) repository. 
  
* [glycosylation-sites-UniCarbKB](glycosylation-sites-UniCarbKB.json) - This BCO was developed with the [Data integration use case](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification/blob/master/introduction.md#data-integration-use-case) in mind.
