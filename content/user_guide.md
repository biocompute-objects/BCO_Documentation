## 1 Introduction

This document specifies the structure of BioCompute Objects. 
The specification is split into multiple parts linked to from this 
top-level document and are maintained in a 
[GithHub repository](https://github.com/biocompute-objects/BCO_Specification)
where [contributions](/#support-community-and-contributing) are welcome.

## 2 BioCompute Domains

BCOs are represented in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formatted text, adhearing to [JSON schema draft-07](https://json-schema.org/specification.html). The JSON format was chosen because it is both human and machine readable/writable. For a detailed description of JSON see [www.json.org](http://www.json.org).

BioCompute data types are defined as aggregates of the critical fields organized into the following domains: the provenance domain, the usability domain, the extension domain, the description domain, the execution domain, the parametric domain, the input and output domains, and the error domain. At the time of creation with actual values compliant to the schema the BCO should be assigned a unique identifier, a [object_id](/top-level#202-biocompute-object-identifier-object_id). The object could then be assigned a unique digital [etag](/top-level#203-etag-etag).

Three of the domains in a BioCompute Object SHOULD become immutable upon assignment of the digital [etag](/top-level#203-etag-etag): 
1) the [Parametric Domain](/parametric-domain)
2) the [Execution Domain](/execution-domain) and 
3) the [I/O Domain](/io-domain)

* [External references](/external-references)

### 3.3 Title 21 CFR Part 11

*Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 11: Electronic Records - Electronic Signatures*

BioCompute project is being developed with Title 21 CFR Part 11 compliance in mind. The digital signatures incorporated into the format will provide the basis for provenance of BioCompute Object integrity using NIST proposed encryption algorithms. Execution domain and parametric domain (that have a potential impact on a result of computation) and identity domain will be used to create hash values and digital signature encryption keys which later can be used for computer or human validation of transmitted objects. 

Discussions are now taking place to consider relevance of BioCompute Objects with relation to Title 21 CFR part 11. We encourage continuous input from BioCompute stakeholders on this subject now and while the concept is becoming more mature and more widely accepted by scientific and regulatory communities.

### 3.4 Appendix IV - Compatibility

#### 3.4.1 ISA for the experimental metadata

ISA is a metadata framework to manage an increasingly diverse set of life science, environmental and biomedical experiments that employ one or a combination of technologies. Built around the **Investigation** (the project context), **Study** (a unit of research) and **Assay** (analytical measurements) concepts, ISA helps to provide rich descriptions of experimental metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, technology and measurement types, sample-to-data relationships) so that the resulting data and discoveries are reproducible and reusable. The ISA Model and Serialization Specifications define an Abstract Model of the metadata framework that has been implemented in two format specifications, ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON ([http://isa-tools.org/format/specification](http://isa-tools.org/format/specification)), both of which have supporting tools and services associated with them, including by a programmable Python AP ([http://isa-tools.org](http://isa-tools.org/format/specification)) and a varied user community and contributors ([http://www.isacommons.org](http://www.isacommons.org)). ISA focuses on structuring experimental metadata; raw and derived data files, codes, workflows etc are considered as external file that are referenced. An example, along its complementarity with other models and a computational workflow is illustrated in this paper, which shows how to explicitly declare elements of experimental design, variables, and findings: [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127612](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127612) 

### 3.5 Appendix VI Acknowledgements

This document began development during the [2017 HTS-CSRS workshop](https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/htscsrs/workshop_2017). The discussion during the workshop led to the refinement and completion of this document. The workshop participants were a major part of the initial BCO community, and the comments and suggestions collected during the sessions were incorporated into this document. The people who participated in the 2017 workshop, and therefore made significant contributions are listed here: [https://osf.io/h59uh/](https://osf.io/h59uh/)
