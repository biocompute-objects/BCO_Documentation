### BioCompute PPP

The BioCompute Public Private Partnership (PPP) is comprised of several groups and individuals from regulatory, academia, and private industry that have contributed to the concept, development, testing, and/or feedback of the BioCompute project. The first formal structure to take shape is the Public Private Partnership, which focuses on the application of the IEEE standard. (Note that the PPP is not responsible for the development of the IEEE standard. The standard was developed by the [P2791 Working Group](https://sagroups.ieee.org/2791/)). The objective of the PPP is to facilitate the efficient communication of certain critical elements of genomic analyses for the purpose of rendering genomic analyses more easily and beneficially consumed by research institutions, clinical and diagnostic care facilities, biotech and pharma entities, and regulatory bodies such as the FDA.

### Leadership

The BioCompute Public Private Partnership is the nexus of many fields with interests in the communication bioinformatic workflow analysis. Leadership for the Public Private Partnership consists of an [Executive Steering Committee](/leadership/#esc), which engages in outreach and has executive oversight over the project, and a [Technical Steering Committee](/leadership/#tsc) which builds tools and resources related to the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8699141" class=regular target="_blank">IEEE-2791-2020</a> standard, and provides technical guidance to the community.. The idea of forming a grassroots community working with the BioCompute Standard (IEEE-2791) was the brainchild of Raja Mazumder (GW)) and Vahan Simonyan(FDA).

### Mission

<b>Develop</b> a community of stakeholders with interests in creating a versatile data harmonization framework
that allows the standardized definition of platform-independent bioinformatics pipelines for execution, and is easily
read by humans and machines. <b>Facilitate</b> the development of tools and facilities implementing data typing,
instantiation, deposition, storage, and distribution of validated BioCompute Objects through a BioCompute
database, in order to enable reproducible scientific research and regulatory submissions of data and computations.
<b>Support</b> portability of pipelines for execution.
 
### Services 
Members of the PPP are provided the following services:
- BCO Certification
- BCO Verification
- BCO Database
- BCO Consultations and Technical Support

### Current members

FDA | Embleema | Argentys | Millipore Sigma | Open Health Systems Laboratory (OHSL)|


<b>PPP governance plan</b>: The Partnership is guided by an Executive Steering Committee.
<br><br><b>Types of activities members are expected to participate in</b>: Representing the company/institute/project&#39;s needs
through participation in meetings. Specifically, we would like members to either contribute through funding and/or
contributions in kind to the development and/or use of BioCompute framework. This participation will allow our
members to determine the course of the BioCompute standard and associated activities.
