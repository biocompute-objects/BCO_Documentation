<h3>2021</h3>
<h4><a name="3-27-21"></a>BioCompute Objects on High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE)</h4>
<b>Date</b>: Saturday March 27 2021

<br>

<h4><a name="5-12-21"></a>Workflow Preservation and Reproducibility with BCO-RO</h4>

<b>Date</b>: Wednesday May 12 2021 at 11:00AM-12:30PM ET
	
<b>Purpose</b>: Training session showing how Research Objects (RO) can package BioCompute Objects (BCO) for Digital Preservation and Reproducibility. Research Objects (RO) are a machine-readable digital preservation effort that aims to package all constituent elements of an analysis together into one archive with very detailed provenance. Here, Stian Soiland-Reyes, a Technical Architect on the Research Objects project, will describe an example that packages the workflow as a descriptive, human-readable report in the form of a BioCompute Object (BCO), and which bundles everything in an RO "Crate." Stian will explain the Research Objects project, and introduce a tutorial for building an RO-BCO archive. RO-BCOs can be efficient solutions for scaling up data analyses, both for internal record keeping and logistics, and for communicating workflows to outside groups.

<h3><a name="7-28-21"></a>Towards Interoperability: Generating BioCompute Objects on Cloud-Based Platforms for Advancing Precision Medicine</h3>

<b>Date</b>: Wednesday July 28 at 11:00AM-12:30PM ET
	
<b>Purpose</b>: The purpose of this workshop is to understand the value of interoperability in both research and regulatory review for scientists in the public or private spaces, and especially from the perspective of FDA personnel. As part of the larger goal of smoothing communication between the FDA and private sector to reduce organization burden on both ends, this workshop will first introduce how the cloud computing platform Seven Bridges can package BioCompute Objects (BCOs) for workflow capture and reproducibility. Following the introduction, we will describe several  previously observed use cases to solicit feedback on their relevance to attendees, potentially from image processing (for diagnosis), machine-learning (for communicating and exchanging models with training data), and/or multi-modal data applications. Agenda can be found on the registration page.

<b>Speaker</b>: Dr. Dennis A. Dean, II is a Principal Investigator at Seven Bridges. He manages and builds interdisciplinary teams that develop complex tools and conduct data analyses from conception to deployment/completion. He leads the Translational Science and Analytics Team that includes data scientists, bioinformaticians, and genomic data scientists. He is responsible for the success of his team members across commercial, government, and internal projects. He leads collaborations with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs Million Veteran Program (MVP) and collaborates with large pharmaceutical companies. Dr. Dean trained as a research fellow in medicine at the Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital in the Program for Sleep Epidemiology and the Program for Sleep and Cardiovascular Medicine. He earned his Ph.D. in biomedical engineering and biotechnology and M.S. in computer science from the University of Massachusetts. He earned his B.S. in computer science from SUNY, Empire State College.
	

	
<h3>2020</h3>

<h4><a name="03-18-20"></a>BioCompute Advisory Boards Workshop</h4>

<b>Date</b>: Wednesday March 18, 2020 2-4pm ET

<b>Purpose</b>: The purpose of this workshop is to facilitate dialogue between Advisory Board(s) members on BioCompute applications, vocabulary, and current + future progression of the project through a hands-on approach. These discussions are a means to obtain feedback, introduce potential use-cases, and bring everyone up to speed about BioCompute.

<b>Date</b>: Wednesday June 24, 2020 10am-12pm ET

<b>Purpose</b>: The purpose of this workshop is to facilitate dialogue and show BCO utility specifically for FDA reviewers. We will be briefly discussing BioCompute applications, vocabulary, current + future progression of the project in addition to a hands-on approach to reviewing a BCO for. These discussions are a means to introduce BCO as a tool for submission evaluation mechanism obtain feedback.

<h4><a name="11-20-20"></a>Introduction to workflow portability with BCO-CWL</h4>

<b>Date</b>: Friday November 20th 2020 at 12-2PM ET
	
<b>Purpose</b>: BioCompute Objects (BCOs) were developed to aid in communicating a more thorough understanding of computational analyses. While BCOs can be leveraged for re-execution within the context of specific platforms that have integrated them, they are not used for cross platform implementations. Common Workflow Language (CWL) was developed to assist in the portability of execution, meaning the ability to reproduce a pipeline in a different computational environment. The BCO and CWL teams have partnered over the last year to develop a joint mechanism that enables both portability of execution and strong human- and machine-readable documentation through metadata records. New functionality of BCO-CWL means that a reviewer may be able to independently run a computational pipeline used by a sponsor if using a command line environment, or on a platform that supports CWL. This presentation will go over the project by introducing the concept of portability of execution, the concept of a CWL file, and demonstrate the initial draft of a BCO-CWL implementation.

<h2>2019<h2>

<h4><a name="05-14-19"></a>BioCompute Objects: Tools for Communicating NGS Data and Analysis</h4>

<b>Date</b>: Tuesday May 14, 2019

<b>Organizers</b>: [FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/center-biologics-evaluation-and-research-cber)

**Purpose:** The BioCompute project has resulted in three prior workshops, two publications, several collaborations, and is currently undergoing formal balloting to become an official IEEE standard. The upcoming Workshop will engage more stakeholders in creating and using BioCompute for NGS and other bioinformatics data analysis communications with the FDA. Specifically, the Workshop will have two components: use case examples, and hands on & demonstrations of new tools that leverage BioCompute. A new Precision FDA-BioCompute Challenge will also be launched at the event.
