### Mission
Develop a community of stakeholders with interests in creating a versatile data harmonization framework
that allows the standardized definition of platform-independent bioinformatics pipelines for execution, and is easily
read by humans and machines. Facilitate the development of tools and facilities implementing data typing,
instantiation, deposition, storage, and distribution of validated BioCompute Objects through a BioCompute
database, in order to enable reproducible scientific research and regulatory submissions of data and computations.
Facilitate portability of pipelines for execution.

<b>PPP governance plan</b>: The Partnership is guided by an Executive Steering Committee.
<br><br><b>Types of activities members are expected to participate in</b>: Representing the company/institute/project&#39;s needs
through participation in meetings. Specifically, we would like members to either contribute through funding and/or
contributions in kind to the development and/or use of BioCompute framework. This participation will allow our
members to determine the course of the BioCompute standard and associated activities.
