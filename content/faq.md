### Pipeline Steps
1) #### Do pipeline steps have to represent sequentially run steps? How can you represent steps also run in parallel? 

	The standard does not mandate any particular numbering schema, but it's best practices to pick the most logically intuitive numbering system. For example, a user may run a somatic SNV profiling step at the same time as a structural CNV analysis.. So if, in the example I mentioned, the alignment is step #2, then you might (arbitrarily) call the SNV profiling step #3, and the CNV analysis step #4. The fact that they pull from the output of the same step (#2) can easily be detected programmatically and represented in whatever way is suitable (e.g. graphically).



### Inputs and Outputs
1) #### What is the relationship and difference between `input_list` in `description_domain` and `input_subdomain` ? Does `input_subdomain` contain all the input files of all the pipeline steps? 

	Yes. The Input Domain is for global inputs. The `input_list`/`output_list` in the `pipeline_steps` is specific to individual steps and is used to trace data flow if granular detail is needed. If not needed, a user can simply look at the IO domain for overall view of the pipeline inputs.

 2) #### What is the relationship and difference between `output_list` in `description_domain` and `output_subdomain`? Does `output_subdomain` contain all the output files of all the pipeline steps?

	The Output Domain is for global outputs. The `input_list`/`output_list` is in the `pipeline_steps` is specific to individual steps and is used to trace data flow if granular detail is needed. If not needed, a user can simply look at the IO domain for overall view of the pipeline outputs.
  
 3) #### There is an "access_time" property for "uri", which is referenced by "input_list",  "output_list",  " input_subdomain " and " output_subdomain ". What does " access_time " mean for output files? Arenâ€™t output files generated by pipeline steps?

 	Yes they are, timestamp is used for creation in those cases. 
 
### Extensions

1) #### What is the role of extension_domain? How does it relate to other domains? Is it required in some pipeline steps? Or does it affect the execution? Or something else?

	Extension Domain is never required, it is always optional. It is a user-defined space for capturing anything not already captured in the base BCO. To use it, one generates an extension schema (referenced in the Extension Domain), and the associated fields within the BCO. For example, if a user wants to include a specialized ontology with definitions, it can be added here. It's meant to capture anything idiosyncratic to that workflow not already captured in the standard, and is very flexible.

### Prerequisets
1) #### What is the difference between "software_prerequisites" in execution_domain and " prerequisites "in description_domain? Is the former global, while the latter only applies to one specific pipeline step?

	Correct, Execution Domain is for anything related to the environment in which the pipeline was executed, and the Description Domain is specific to the softwares in those steps. So if I've written a shell script to run the pipeline, and in one step it includes myScript.py to comb through results and pick out elements of interest, myScript.py might be an Execution Domain prerequisite, and any packages or dependencies called from within the script are Description Domain level prerequisites. Alternatively, if I'm using the HIVE platform, any libraries needed to run HIVE are Execution Domain level.
