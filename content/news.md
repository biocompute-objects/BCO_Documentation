FDA announces support for BioCompute! The July 22nd, 2020 edition of the Federal Register [announced](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/07/22/2020-15771/electronic-submissions-data-standards-support-for-the-international-institute-of-electrical-and) that the FDA now supports BioCompute (officially known as IEEE 2791-2020), and that the standard will be added to the [Data Standards Catalog](https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-resources-data-standards).

**June 24th, 2020**

BioCompute training for FDA Reviewers and administrators took place today virtually. The workshop introduced the core concepts of BioCompute, terminology, and walked through usage examples in the context of regulatory submission filings, taken from sample use cases organized with FDA Reviewers. The training was constructed with input from advisory boards, and was focused on receiving a BCO as part of a regulatory filing, rather than technical details. What kinds of information is included in a BCO, where to find relevant information in certain scenarios, and ways to use additional optional fields to include or ask for more information were presented. Supplemental training material like the [quick reference guide](/docs/BCOCheatSheet.pdf) (PDF) was also provided.

**May 14th, 2020**

The IEEE Standard, now known as 2791-2020, has [officially published](https://standards.ieee.org/content/ieee-standards/en/standard/2791-2020.html). The standard can be purchased through the IEEE website, and the open source Schema referred to in the standard can be accessed [here](https://opensource.ieee.org/2791-object/ieee-2791-schema).

**March 18th, 2020**

Training for FDA personnel begins! The BioCompute team met with FDA reviewers and administrators to discuss the needs of FDA personnel and how best to implement BioCompute training. In a series of workshops, tutorials, demonstrations, and other training exercises, the BioCompute team will work with FDA Reviewers and administrators to understand BCOs and interpret information in BCO format, and will discuss the Extension Domains for acquiring extra information.

**January 30th, 2020**

The IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) has officially approved P2791 for publication. This marks formal acceptance as a standard, and clears the way for publishing. P2791 is one of the first standards to go through the IEEE Open Source Pilot Project, meaning the source for the entire project is open source (currently available [here](https://gitlab.com/IEEE-SA/2791/ieee-2791-schema)). Updates will be posted when the standard is officially published.

**January 8th, 2020**

The Review Committee (RevCom) for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) voted to recommend approving P2791, the proposed standard that embodies the BioCompute specification. The [specification](/specification) is an open source document (viewable [here](https://gitlab.com/IEEE-SA/2791/ieee-2791-schema)) that describes the propsed standard, and the vote to approve is major milestone in the project's development. The next step is for the Standards Association (IEEE SA) to vote on the proposed standard based on this recommendation. In the event that it is approved, P2791 will become a formal, IEEE recognized standard!

**October 18th, 2019**

The BCO Challenge on PrecisionFDA has closed. Reviewers are currently evaluating both the beginner and advanced tracks, and will report their top performers on the [PrecisionFDA website](https://precision.fda.gov/challenges/7/view/results). Congratulations to all who participated, and thank you for helping to build the BioCompute project!

**September 23rd, 2019**

We're excited to announce a new program to build a BioComputeDB for the FDA. The database will be a publicly accessible mechanism to facilitate better scientific communication of workflows with little additional communication, outside of the initial submission. As part of the program, we will gather input regarding needs and use cases from FDA personnel that will be used to build the database, and we will train FDA reviewers and researchers. Initial workshops will begin at the FDA in early 2020.

**July 14th, 2019**

BioCompute will be represented at the 52nd annual [Association of Pathology Chairs](https://www.apcprods.org/) Meeting in Boston, MA July 21 - 24.

The [PLoS Bio paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000099) describing the BioCompute project [has been featured on the PLoS Open Source Toolkit](https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit)! The Open Source Toolkit is a global forum for open source hadware and software. Its forum helps BioCompute reach a wider audience and cement its status as an invaluable specification for the communication of high throughput sequencing analysis. The paper is currently the first paper in "Featured Research."

**December 31st, 2018**

Several members of the BioCompute community, in both the public and private sectors, have joined together to [publish a manuscript](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000099) describing the BioCompute project. The theory, utility, and implementation of the BioCompute specification are described, along with use cases.

**December 23rd, 2018**

The [P2791 Working Group](http://sites.ieee.org/sagroups-2791/) to build an IEEE BioCompute standard has formally voted to move ahead with the process. This means that the IEEE Sponsor will review the document, followed by an official Ballot Group review, and a public comment period. This is exciting news, and a major step for BioCompute. Standardization of BioCompute will create a formal mechanism for creating, commenting on, and using a way to communicate next generation sequencing data in a consensus-driven way.
