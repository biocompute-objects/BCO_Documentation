                "description": "The local realignment process is designed to consume one or more BAM files and to locally realign reads such that the number of mismatching bases is minimized across all the reads. In general, a large percent of regions requiring local realignment are due to the presence of an insertion or deletion (indels) in the individual's genome with respect to the reference genome. Such alignment artifacts result in many bases mismatching the reference near the misalignment, which are easily mistaken as SNPs. Moreover, since read mapping algorithms operate on each read independently, it is impossible to place reads on the reference genome such at mismatches are minimized across all reads. Consequently, even when some reads are correctly mapped with indels, reads covering the indel near just the start or end of the read are often incorrectly mapped with respect the true indel, also requiring realignment. Local realignment serves to transform regions with misalignments due to indels into clean reads containing a consensus indel suitable for standard variant discovery approaches. Unlike most mappers, this walker uses the full alignment context to determine whether an appropriate alternate reference (i.e. indel) exists. Following local realignment, the GATK tool Unified Genotyper can be used to sensitively and specifically identify indels.\n\nThere are 2 steps to the realignment process:\n\n1. Determining (small) suspicious intervals which are likely in need of realignment (see the RealignerTargetCreator tool)\n2. Running the realigner over those intervals (IndelRealigner)\nFor more details, see the indel realignment method documentation.\n\nInput\nOne or more aligned BAM files and optionally one or more lists of known indels.\n\nOutput\nA realigned version of your input BAM file(s).\n\nUsage example:\n java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \\\n   -T IndelRealigner \\\n   -R reference.fasta \\\n   -I input.bam \\\n   --known indels.vcf \\\n   -targetIntervals intervalListFromRTC.intervals \\\n   -o realignedBam.bam\n \nCaveats\n\nThe input BAM(s), reference, and known indel file(s) should be the same ones to be used for the IndelRealigner step.\nBecause reads produced from the 454 technology inherently contain false indels, the realigner will not work with them (or with reads from similar technologies).\nThis tool also ignores MQ0 reads and reads with consecutive indel operators in the CIGAR string.\n\n(IMPORTANT) Reference \".fasta\" Secondary Files\n\nTools in GATK that require a fasta reference file also look for the reference file's corresponding .fai (fasta index) and .dict (fasta dictionary) files. The fasta index file allows random access to reference bases and the dictionary file is a dictionary of the contig names and sizes contained within the fasta reference. These two secondary files are essential for GATK to work properly. To append these two files to your fasta reference please use the 'SBG FASTA Indices' tool within your GATK based workflow before using any of the GATK tools.",

Indel realignment is accomplished internally using a read-independent method, and issues resulting from discordant alignments are dramatically reduced through the direct detection of haplotypes.\n2. The need for base quality recalibration is avoided through the direct detection of haplotypes. Sequencing platform errors tend to cluster (e.g. at the ends of reads), and generate unique, non-repeating haplotypes at a given locus.\n3. Variant quality recalibration is avoided by incorporating a number of metrics, such as read placement bias and allele balance, directly into the Bayesian model.\n\n###Common Issues\nFASTA INDEX FILE is not required. If it is not provided (as secondary file), it is generated. When it is provided, the tool runs faster.\nBAM INDEX FILES are not required, but when not provided (as separate input), random access is disabled.\nVARIANT INPUT INDEX FILE is required (as secondary file). It should be generated using Tabix BGZIP and Tabix Index file.\nREGION parameter should match data present in variant input file, both chromosome and positions.",
