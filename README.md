#### High-throughput Sequencing Computational Standards for Regulatory Sciences (HTS-CSRS) Project

This document specifies the structure of BioCompute Objects and was created by the High Throughput Sequencing Computational Standards for Regulatory Sciences (HTS-CSRS) project. This project was focused on providing the scientific community with a framework to harmonize bio-computing, promote interoperability, and verify bioinformatics protocols. For more information, see the project description on the FDA Extramural Research page

An example [ResearchObject](http://www.researchobject.org/) with a [Common Workflow Language](http://www.commonwl.org/) workflow embedded inside that acts as a variation on the BioCompute Object vision is available at https://github.com/common-workflow-language/hive-cwl-examples
